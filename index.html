                Gazpacho Manchegos only shares its name with the cold soup
                gazpacho that is mainly consumed during the summer, as this is a
                mainly a game meat stew eaten with unleavened bread cakes. The
                only relation between the two is the the use of bread. While
                gazpacho is original from Andalusia, Gazpachos Manchegos
                originates in La Mancha, and in fact is mentioned in Don Quixote
                with one of its other names "galiano", however it is eaten in
                many areas, including the Spanish regions of Alicante and
                Valencia.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                There are also similar dishes which are eaten in other
                countries, including gaspacho oranais which is eaten in the
                North-West of Algeria. While the Andalusian gazpacho is
                singular, the Manchego one is plural. It was the shepherds of La
                Mancha that created this dish, and in fact galiano means "glen".

                Its flaky pastry exterior holds apples, cheese, potatoes,
                onions, leeks, bacon, and pears. Seen as a way to use leftovers
                (like extra Gschwellti (boiled potatoes) from your raclette),
                and not really held to any strict rules about what and how much
                goes in (as many versions as there are grandmothers in the
                Wallis etc.) it is an easily customizable, delicious and filling
                dish.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                There is a persistent rumour that the dish is indeed named for
                the disease Cholera, after a particularly bad outbreak in the
                1830s. People in the Wallis stayed home to avoid contamination
                and were forced to use things they already had in their larder
                and gardens to feed their families.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                More likely, however, is that it's named after the glowing coal
                in the fireplace where the pan would have sat to bake.

                Sometimes can be hard to eat out as a vegan here in Spain, but
                it’s not impossible and in recent years, the number of vegan or
                vegetarian restaurants has increased. In Sevilla is easy to find
                Spanish spinach with chickpeas (espinacas con garbanzos in
                Spanish) in many traditional restaurants. Everybody loves it,
                even those who hate veggies, especially if you use finely
                chopped fresh spinach.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s common to use a lot of oil to make this delicious dish, but
                I prefer this lighter version, it’s healthier and tastes amazing
                too. You only need 6 ingredients to make spinach with chickpeas:
                extra virgin olive oil, garlic, sweet paprika, spinach,
                chickpeas and salt (optional).

                The sweet potatoes (or yams in this case) are roasted until fork
                tender, then broiled to get a little color, then topped with a
                delicious pan sauce made with finely minced shallots, ginger and
                miso. Though simple, we sometimes served this for dinner as our
                “main” with a large salad and find it deeply filling and
                satisfying.

                The secret to making amazing Thai curries is to use plenty of
                aromatics, like onion, ginger and garlic. Feel free to change up
                the vegetables, as long as you slice them so they’re all pretty
                small and about the same size. You could try broccoli,
                cauliflower, mushrooms, diced butternut or sweet potato (which
                will probably require a longer cooking time), sliced zucchini
                and/or yellow squash.

                This Thai red curry recipe is so easy to make at home! It’s much
                tastier than takeout and healthier, too. Feel free to change up
                the vegetables (you’ll need about 3 cups total) and skip the
                kale if you want a more traditional Thai curry. This recipe is
                vegetarian, vegan and gluten free for all to enjoy. Recipe
