          <h2 class="card-title">Gazpacho Manchego</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            Gazpacho Manchegos only shares its name with the cold soup gazpacho
            that is mainly consumed during the summer, as this is a mainly a
            game meat stew eaten with unleavened bread cakes. The only relation
            between the two is the the use of bread. While gazpacho is original
            from Andalusia, Gazpachos Manchegos originates in La Mancha, and in
            fact is mentioned in Don Quixote with one of its other names
            "galiano", however it is eaten in many areas, including the Spanish
            regions of Alicante and Valencia.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            There are also similar dishes which are eaten in other countries,
            including gaspacho oranais which is eaten in the North-West of
            Algeria. While the Andalusian gazpacho is singular, the Manchego one
            is plural. It was the shepherds of La Mancha that created this dish,
            and in fact galiano means "glen".

          <h2 class="card-title">Walliser Cholera</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            Its flaky pastry exterior holds apples, cheese, potatoes, onions,
            leeks, bacon, and pears. Seen as a way to use leftovers (like extra
            Gschwellti (boiled potatoes) from your raclette), and not really
            held to any strict rules about what and how much goes in (as many
            versions as there are grandmothers in the Wallis etc.) it is an
            easily customizable, delicious and filling dish.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            There is a persistent rumour that the dish is indeed named for the
            disease Cholera, after a particularly bad outbreak in the 1830s.
            People in the Wallis stayed home to avoid contamination and were
            forced to use things they already had in their larder and gardens to
            feed their families.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            More likely, however, is that it's named after the glowing coal in
            the fireplace where the pan would have sat to bake.
