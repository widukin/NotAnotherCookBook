            Its flaky pastry exterior holds apples, cheese, potatoes, onions,
            leeks, bacon, and pears. Seen as a way to use leftovers (like extra
            Gschwellti (boiled potatoes) from your raclette), and not really
            held to any strict rules about what and how much goes in (as many
            versions as there are grandmothers in the Wallis etc.) it is an
            easily customizable, delicious and filling dish.
          </p>
          <p class="description mt-3">
            There is a persistent rumour that the dish is indeed named for the
            disease Cholera, after a particularly bad outbreak in the 1830s.
            People in the Wallis stayed home to avoid contamination and were
            forced to use things they already had in their larder and gardens to
            feed their families.
          </p>
          <p class="description mt-3">
            More likely, however, is that it's named after the glowing coal in
            the fireplace where the pan would have sat to bake.

            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">800 g small boiled potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li class="mb-2">1 egg</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Preparation</h2>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">1.</h2>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F / gas mark 4.</p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">2.</h2>
          <p>
            Line the bottom of a 28 cm (11 inch) springform pan with parchment
            paper.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">2.</h2>
          <p>
            Line the pan with one package of dough. Keep the tart shell cool
            (preferably in the freezer) until you have the filling ready.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">3.</h2>
          <p>
            In a medium pan, melt the butter until spluttering. Add the leeks
            and onions and fry for about 7 minutes or until softened. Season
            with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Remove from pan and let cool. Using
            the same pan, quickly fry the bacon until it is a bit crispy. Let
            cool.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">4.</h2>
          <p>
            Now for the filling. According to Marie Furrer, you should fill the
            pie in layers and the order should be as follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>onions and leeks</li>
            <li>bacon</li>
            <li>pears</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">5.</h2>
          <p>
            Although it depends on how thinly everything is sliced, you should
            be able to get in at least two sets of layers. You can lightly
            nutmeg, salt and pepper some of the layers as you add them,
            according to your taste.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">6.</h2>
          <p>
            Once you run out of filling, or make it to the top, cover with the
            second package of puff pastry and seal the edges well. Using any
            leftover dough, cut out some shapes to decorate the lid.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">7.</h2>
          <p>
            In a separate dish, whisk together the egg and a pinch of salt, then
            brush the top of the pie.
          </p>

          <h2 class="marker pl-1">8.</h2>
          <p>Bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden.</p>
