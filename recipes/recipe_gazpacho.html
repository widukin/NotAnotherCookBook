          <p class="description mt-3">
            Gazpacho Manchego only shares its name with the cold soup gazpacho
            that is mainly consumed during the summer, as this is a mainly a
            game meat stew eaten with unleavened bread cakes. The only relation
            between the two is the the use of bread. While gazpacho is original
            from Andalusia, Gazpachos Manchegos originates in La Mancha, and in
            fact is mentioned in Don Quixote with one of its other names
            "galiano", however it is eaten in many areas, including the Spanish
            regions of Alicante and Valencia.
          </p>
          <p class="description mt-3">
            There are also similar dishes which are eaten in other countries,
            including gaspacho oranais which is eaten in the North-West of
            Algeria. While the Andalusian gazpacho is singular, the Manchego one
            is plural. It was the shepherds of La Mancha that created this dish,
            and in fact galiano means "glen".
