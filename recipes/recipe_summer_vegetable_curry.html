          <p class="description mt-3">
            This quick vegetarian curry from Heidi Swanson, the vegetarian cookbook
            author and blogger behind 101 Cookbooks, is a great way to use a CSA’s
            bounty of eggplant and summer squash. Feel free to change that lineup
            depending on your haul. You can eat the curry as is, or ladle it over
            cooked noodles or rice to add some heft.

          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Preparation</h2>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">1.</h2>
          <p>
            Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over
            medium-high. Add tofu in a single layer and cook, turning over once,
            until cooked sides are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper
            towels to drain. Season with kosher salt.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">2.</h2>
          <p>
            Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot or high-sided skillet over
            medium-high. Add onions and a generous pinch of salt and stir to coat.
            Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in curry
            paste and cook, stirring often, until darkened in color, about 2
            minutes. Add zucchini, eggplant, and green beans and cook, tossing to
            coat, until vegetables are softened and starting to brown in spots, 5–7
            minutes. Pour in coconut milk and ½ cup water and bring to a simmer.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">3.</h2>
          <p>
            Add tofu to pot and stir gently to combine. Cook until warmed through,
            about 3 minutes. Season with more salt if needed.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">4.</h2>
          <p>
            Divide curry among bowls and add a generous squeeze of lime juice to
            each. Top with cilantro and peanuts.
