          <h1 class="mt-5">Thai Red Curry with Vegetables</h1>
          <p class="description mt-3">
            This Thai red curry recipe is so easy to make at home! It’s much
            tastier than takeout and healthier, too. Feel free to change up the
            vegetables (you’ll need about 3 cups total) and skip the kale if you
            want a more traditional Thai curry. This recipe is vegetarian, vegan
            and gluten free for all to enjoy. Recipe yields 4 servings.

          </ul>
          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Preparation</h2>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">1.</h2>
          <p>
            To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed
            rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary
            to prevent overflow. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the
            rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer,
            until you’re ready to serve. Just before serving, season the rice to
            taste with salt and fluff it with a fork.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">2.</h2>
          <p>
            To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium
            heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of
            salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is
            turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and
            cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">3.</h2>
          <p>
            Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are
            fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add
            the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">4.</h2>
          <p>
            Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine.
            Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as
            necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers,
            carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10
            minutes, stirring occasionally.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marker pl-1">5.</h2>
          <p>
            Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice
            vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste.
            If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari,
            or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice
            and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro and a
            sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you’d like. If you love spicy
            curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.
